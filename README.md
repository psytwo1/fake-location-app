# FakeLocationApp
FakeLocationApp sends location information to Firestore.
You can switch whether to disguise the location information to be sent.
This feature allows for natural camouflage.
Since it does not disguise the location information of the execution terminal itself, it is possible to use applications that require real location information such as navigation while disguising the location information.
